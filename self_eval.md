# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I am feeling mostly confident, but still challenged.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I believe I am getting the material.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
The if statements tend to throw me off sometimes to follow the logic, but I enjoy them and feel fairly confident so far.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I was not expecting to spend a few hours on this one, but I get why after completing it. It did not line up with my estimate at all, I had somehow got it in my head that all lessons take an hour or so. Glad for the heads up!
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I believe I will be going back over the other coding challenges to keep the practice going so it feels more comfortable. That will be later this evening after my brain has chilled for a moment or two.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I have already found myself spending quite a bit of time googling questions and issues. I feel like I will be spending a lot of time there.
